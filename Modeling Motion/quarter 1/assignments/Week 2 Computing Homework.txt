Week 2 Computing HomeworkModeling Motion
Week 2 Computing Homework
Due: Tuesday January 13
The only thing you need to turn in is your modified version of the program in 
exercise 4 and your answers to the two questions there. Just turn in a sheet of 
paper with your program and answers. 
You may be interested in looking at the Instant Hacking introduction to Python 
as a good but short introduction to the language. I've listed it on the Python 
Resources page.
  Install Python: Go to http://vpython.org/download.html and download the 
  packages needed for your platform. On windows there are files to download to 
  your hard disk.Python-2.3.exe and VPython-2003-10-05.exe
  These two files are programs you can execute on your computer to install 
  Python and the VPython extensions. As noted on the download page, you should 
  install Python first and you should be sure to let it install itself at the 
  suggested place on your hardrive (C:\Python23). 
  Verify Python is installed properly: Start up the development tool called 
  "IDLE". It should be visible in Windows either as a shortcut on the desktop or 
  in the Start menu (In the CAL look under Program Files->Development 
  Tools->Python->IDLE). Try typing in the following short Python program from 
  the lecture (or Cut & Paste). Remember the indention is important. Python 
  doesn't care how much you indent the body of the 'for' loop but you must 
  indent both of statements the same amount. Run the program either from the 
  menu (Run->Run Module) or by hitting the F5 key.
for t in range(11):
    x = 2 + 3*t
    print t,x

  Verify VPython works properly: Try the following program which should draw a 
  nice figure when executed. You can rotate and zoom the figure by dragging 
  mouse on it with the right and middle buttons respectively. Try changing the 
  values of numbers and see what happens. 
from visual import *

mything = curve(radius=1)
angle=0;
radius=20;

while angle<=18.1*pi:
    x=radius*cos(angle)
    y=radius*sin(angle)
    z=radius*sin((11/9.)*angle)
    angle = angle + pi/10

    red  =1+sin(pi/2+angle)/2
    green=1+sin(3*pi/2+angle)/2
    blue =1+sin(angle)/2

    mything.append(pos=(x,y,z),color=(red,green,blue))
    rate(30) #control the drawing speed


  Doing physics in Python: The following program is similar to one shown in 
  class. It prints a table of the displacements of a particle in uniform motion 
  at several instants in time. This version uses a 'while' loop. Its slightly 
  different than those we've seen before. The method we have seen before 
  computes position x for any time t with a function ( x = f(t) = x0 + vt). This 
  program computes how far the particle should move each time interval (&#916;x) and 
  adds that to the particle's previous position. See if you can modify this 
  program to make it simulate an object moving with uniform acceleration of -1 
  meter per second per second. Recall that uniform acceleration means that 
  during each time interval (&#916;t) the velocity changes by a constant amount. Use 
  your program to answer these questions: 
    What is the displacement of the particle at t=10 seconds? 
    What is the displacement of the particle at t=20 seconds? 
from visual import *

x  =  0   # starting position
v  =  5   # v is velocity in m/s
t  =  0   # starting time in seconds
dt =  1   # delta t, the change in time

while t<=10 :
      print t,x
      x = x + v*dt
      t = t +   dt

  Solution
#-----------------------------------------------
# Uniform Acceleration - computes displacement of a particle undergoing uniform
#                        acceleration in one dimension.

#-----------------------------------------------
x  =  0   # starting position
v  =  5   # v is velocity in m/s
a  = -1   # a is the acceleration in m/s/s
t  =  0   # starting time in seconds
dt =  1   # delta t, the change in time

while t<=20 :
      print t,x
      x = x + v*dt
      v = v + a*dt
      t = t +   dt


    x=5 at time t=10 
    x=-90 at time t=20
